# Thomas Nicholson Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio site built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Styling is handled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Development

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Create a production build using:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the built site locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The project is designed to be deployed to GitHub Pages. After running the build command, deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to the desired GitHub Pages branch (for example `gh-pages` or the repository's root if using `username.github.io`).
